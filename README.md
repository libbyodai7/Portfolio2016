My Portfolio Website

Hi! I’m Libby Odai, 

I’m a recent graduate of Digital Media Design now based in London. This is my website to showcase the things I make.

I love to code, and I’m really interested in using technology to create interactive experiences. I’m particularly focused on looking at new ways people can interact with computers and data.

I hope you like my site, you can also read more about my projects on my blog.
